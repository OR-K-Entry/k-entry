## Processing EC Indicators from Census Data
Starts with importing the .csv of economic indicators produced in indicators.Rmd in this project. 

```{r load data}
indic = read_csv(here("data/ec_indicators_trc.csv"))
```

## Prelim Exploration

```{r skim, echo=FALSE}
skimr::skim(indic)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
